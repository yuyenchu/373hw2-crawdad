Yen-Chu Yu individual writeup 

My partner is Hoang Nguyen. When I first know that we're implementing a calculator, I was really exited about it. 
Through the project I experienced many interesting problems and solved them, so I really enjoy it. I think the original 
code should be reviewed before published because I found a small bug in the assertNodeMatches.

When Working with my partner, I'll usually start coding the main functions first, and then my partner will review my code
and debug. I think the work we do are equal because both coding and debugging are important, so I'll say my partner and I
contributed equally to this project.
